## {EPITECH} | 1st year | DOP (Introduction to DevOps)

⚠️ For Epitech students, don't copy-paste the code, be aware of the -42 ⚠️

### Subject : &nbsp;

Whatever your opinions might be, this is a chocolatine.

But what purpose does it serve? It allows you to go through the day and through your work better. In other
words, it facilitate your work and allows you to focus on things that matter (discussing its name does not
pertain to this category).

Your repositories are hosted on GitHub, and GitHub has an intuitive way of automating the launch of predefined actions, triggered by events of your choice. It is, in the same way as chocolatines, a great way to
facilitate and enhance your development and your workflow.

You will setup a GitHub Actions workflow to enforce good practices and diverse rules in a
repository

Read the subject for more details and examples.

Good luck.
